# Frontend Engineering Challenge

## Overview

Thank you for your interest in Charged Particles! The purpose of this challenge is to assess potential new team members' frontend engineering and Web3 skills. This challenge consists of 2 parts and may be followed by a short call with a team member to walk through your thought process and code. The first part is the coding challenge itself, in which you will connect to our contracts, mint a Proton, and display it on the UI.

Feel free to solve these questions however you see fit, using whatever coding style or third-party libraries you think are appropriate.

## Rules

1. You have 3 days to complete this challenge, please reach out to sam@charged.fi if this timeline does not work for you.
2. No cheating or plagiarism -- if you use a code snippet from another source please include a source as well as a comment within the code itself explaining how the code works. That being said, we prefer you use entirely original code.
3. Applicants must complete all parts of the challenge, including the self-assessment.

## Success Criteria

Successful submissions will contain:

- a well-functioning, visually appealing solution to the coding challenge
- clean, well-organized code
- clearly written responses to the self-assessment

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Complete the coding challenge. A markdown file with specific requirements and starter code for the challenge can be found in `./code`.
3. Answer all questions in the `self-assessment.md` file.
4. Once you've completed the test, please compress your files (via zip or tar) and return them as a link or email attachment in reply to your test invite. **We'd like the code in your submission to remain private, so please avoid committing or pushing the code publicly.**
